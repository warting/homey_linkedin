# LinkedIn Homey App Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan for creating a Homey app that integrates with LinkedIn, allowing users to post content as a user, page, or showcase.

## Project Overview

- **App Name**: LinkedIn
- **Description**: A Homey app that enables posting to LinkedIn as a user, page, or showcase.
- **ID**: se.premex.linkedin
- **Author**: Stefan WÃ¤rting

## Architecture Overview

The app will follow Homey's recommended architecture:

1. **App Core**: Main application logic and LinkedIn API integration
2. **Drivers**: Device representation for different LinkedIn entities (user, page, showcase)
3. **Flow Cards**: Enabling automation workflows for LinkedIn posting
4. **Capabilities**: Representing the state and abilities of LinkedIn entities

## Development Steps

### 1. Setup & Configuration

- [x] Initialize project using Homey CLI (`homey app create`) - *Already completed*
- [x] Set up TypeScript configuration - *Completed*
- [x] Define app permissions in app.json (required for LinkedIn API access) - *Completed*
- [x] Create necessary assets (icons, images) - *Completed*

### 2. LinkedIn API Integration

- [ ] Implement OAuth2 authentication flow for LinkedIn
- [ ] Create service classes for LinkedIn API communication
- [ ] Implement core posting functionality (text, media, URL sharing)
- [ ] Add error handling and rate limit management

### 3. Driver Development

Create drivers for different LinkedIn entity types using `homey app driver create`:

- [ ] **LinkedIn User Driver**: Represent a personal LinkedIn account
  - Authentication and user profile information
  - Post status updates on behalf of a user

- [ ] **LinkedIn Page Driver**: Represent a LinkedIn company page
  - Page authentication and management
  - Post updates as a company page

- [ ] **LinkedIn Showcase Driver**: Represent a LinkedIn showcase page
  - Showcase page authentication
  - Post updates to showcase pages

### 4. Flow Card Development

Create flow cards using `homey app flow create`:

- [ ] **Action Cards**:
  - Post a text update to LinkedIn
  - Post a URL with preview to LinkedIn
  - Post an image with text to LinkedIn
  - Post a document to LinkedIn
  - Schedule a post for later

- [ ] **Condition Cards**:
  - Check if authenticated to LinkedIn
  - Check posting limits/rate limits

- [ ] **Trigger Cards**:
  - When a LinkedIn post receives engagement
  - When a LinkedIn connection request is received

### 5. Settings & Configuration

- [ ] Create app settings page for global configurations
- [ ] Driver settings for account management
- [ ] Create connection wizards for authentication

### 6. Testing & Validation

- [ ] Unit testing for API integration
- [ ] Flow card testing
- [ ] End-to-end testing with actual LinkedIn accounts
- [ ] Validate app using `homey app validate`

### 7. Documentation & Deployment

- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with setup instructions
- [ ] Prepare app for submission to Homey App Store
- [ ] Build and publish app using GitHub workflows

## Technical Implementation Details

### LinkedIn API Integration

The app will use LinkedIn's REST APIs:
- Marketing Developer Platform for company pages
- Sign In With LinkedIn for user authentication
- Share API for posting content

Required OAuth 2.0 scopes:
- r_liteprofile
- r_emailaddress
- w_member_social
- w_organization_social

### Data Models

1. **LinkedIn Post**:
   - Text content
   - Media attachments (images, documents)
   - URLs and link previews
   - Visibility settings

2. **LinkedIn User**:
   - Profile information
   - Connection status
   - Post history

3. **LinkedIn Page/Showcase**:
   - Page information
   - Admin rights
   - Post history

### Key Implementation Notes

1. **Authentication Storage**:
   - Store OAuth tokens securely
   - Implement token refresh mechanism
   - Handle revoked access gracefully

2. **Post Creation**:
   - Support various content types
   - Handle media uploads
   - Provide posting status and feedback

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Network connectivity issues
   - API limits and restrictions
   - Authentication failures

## Instructions for GitHub Copilot Agent

As a GitHub Copilot agent working on this project, follow these guidelines:

1. **Step-by-Step Implementation**:
   - Focus on one component at a time, starting with core LinkedIn API integration
   - Use the Homey CLI to generate required files and structure
   - Follow TypeScript best practices for type safety

2. **API Integration**:
   - Implement a LinkedIn service class that handles authentication and API calls
   - Use OAuth2 for secure authentication with LinkedIn
   - Create methods for each post type (text, image, document, URL)

3. **Driver Development**:
   - Create separate drivers for user accounts, pages, and showcases
   - Implement paired device flows for authentication
   - Store credentials securely and refresh tokens when needed

4. **Flow Card Implementation**:
   - Create action cards for posting different types of content
   - Implement validation and error handling
   - Add user-friendly descriptions and input fields

5. **Testing**:
   - Validate the app regularly using `homey app validate`
   - Test OAuth flows completely
   - Ensure error messages are user-friendly

6. **Code Structure**:
   - Keep API concerns separate from Homey-specific code
   - Create utility functions for common operations
   - Document code with JSDoc comments

7. **Finalization**:
   - Ensure all settings pages are functional
   - Complete translations for all user-facing text
   - Validate the app before submission
